Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 32

Approximate run time: Variable depending on whether it is targeted sequencing or whole genome sequencing, as well as coverage and the individual analyses requested. For instance, a 90X human sample run (options: `--snp --sv --mod --str --cnv --phased --sex XY`) takes less than 8h with recommended resources.

ARM processor support: False
